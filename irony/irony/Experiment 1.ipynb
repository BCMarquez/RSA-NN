    "For each of the nine weather contexts, we obtained the number of participants who gave each of the weather state ratings. By performing add-one Laplace smoothing on the counts, we computed a smoothed prior distribution over weather states given each context, namely $P(s)$ (Figure 3). To examine participantsâ€™ ratings of the affect associated. with each context, we first performed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the seven emotion category ratings. This allowed us to compress the ratings onto a lower-dimensional space and reveal the main affective dimensions that are important in this domain, as is often done in affective science (Russell, 1980). We found that the first two principal components corresponded to the dimensions of emotional valence and emotional arousal, accounting for 69.14% and 13.86% of the variance in the data, respectively. The PCA represents emotion ratings for each trial as real values between negative and positive infinity on each of the dimensions. To map these values onto probability space, we first standardized the scores on each dimension to have zero mean and unit variance. We then used the cumulative distribution function to convert the standardized scores into values between 0 and 1. This gives us the probabilities of Ann feeling positive (vs. negative) valence and high (vs. low) arousal for each trial, which is a twodimensional probabilistic representation of her affect. By calculating the average probabilities of positive valence and high arousal given each weather state rating, we obtain the probability of positive valence and high arousal associated with each weather state, namely $P(A|s)$ (Figure 4)."
